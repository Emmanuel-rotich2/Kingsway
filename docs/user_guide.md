# Kingsway School Management System - User Guide

Welcome to the Kingsway School Management System!

This system features a modern, real-time, API-driven frontend:
- All data and actions are handled via a centralized JavaScript API (`api.js`)
- Real-time auto-reload of dashboards and tables (every 30 seconds)
- Unified notification modal for all feedback and errors
- Dummy data fallback ensures the UI is always populated

For step-by-step instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](quick_start.md).
For technical/API details, see the [API Guide](api_guide.md).

If you need further help, contact your system administrator or support team.

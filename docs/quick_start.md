# Kingsway School Management System - Quick Start Guide

## Modern Frontend Overview

- **All data flows through `js/api.js`**: All pages and dashboards fetch and update data via a centralized JavaScript API helper.
- **Real-time auto-reload**: Tables, dashboards, and data-driven components auto-refresh every 30 seconds for up-to-date information.
- **Unified notification modal**: All notifications, errors, and feedback use a single Bootstrap modal, color-coded for success, error, warning, and info.
- **Dummy data fallback**: If the backend returns no data, the UI remains populated with dummy data for a seamless experience.
- **No legacy PHP rendering or direct AJAX/fetch**: All data and actions are API-driven and handled via `api.js` and the notification modal.
